# stAte_Scraping
This is a program that automatically scrapes the history of the university's currency (currency used at Arkansas State University) at regular intervals and sends the total amount spent from the day you redeem money and the balance to the official account of the communication application, LINE.

Note:
Currently, after logging in to the target site and performing the two-step verification, the user is taken to the site's home page, which does not work properly. The reason, I am guessing, is that it is recognized as a bot.
